My Little Pony is a brand of plastic ponies produced since 1983 by the toy manufacturer Hasbro.
Marketed primarily to girls, the ponies feature colorful bodies and manes and a unique symbol on one or both sides of their flanks, referred to in the two most recent generations as "cutie marks".
Following the original My Pretty Pony toy, introduced in 1981, My Little Pony was launched in 1983 and the line became popular during the 1980s.
The original toy line ran from 1983 to 1995 (1992 in the US), and inspired animated specials, an animated feature length film and three animated television series.
The toy line had a later release in Japan, by Takara in the '80s during Generation 1, and by Takara Tomy in 2006.
"My Little Pony" was created in 1982 by American illustrator and designer Bonnie Zacherle.
Working with sculptor Charles Muenchinger and manger Steve D'Aguanno, Zacherle submitted a design patent in August 1981 for an ornamental design for a toy animal.
The patent was granted in August 1983, when she began working for Hasbro.
